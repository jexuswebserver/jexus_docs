Background
----------
Jexus Manager has been designed to be compatible with Microsoft IIS Manager, so
that it helps many developers to manage IIS and IIS Express with intuitive user
interface.

In the meantime, Visual Studio Code users often find it difficult to work with
IIS/IIS Express, because no existing extension provides rich access to all the
important settings.

That's why this new IIS and IIS Express extension for Visual Studio Code is
made available now to bridges the two worlds. Developers can now easily launch
Jexus Manager to manage IIS/IIS Express while working on web projects inside
Visual Studio Code.

Install The Extension
---------------------
The extension has been published to `VS Code Marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.iis>`_
so you can install it easily from there.

You should also install Jexus Manager following :doc:`/getting-started/install`
as it is the required dependency.

Select Existing Configuration Files
-----------------------------------
If you open an ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core project in VS Code, it might already
have a configuration file generated by Visual Studio or Rider.

This extension scans the working directory and detects all the files that named
`applicationhost.config` so that from newly added status bar button you can
flip among the files or a temp file `.iis\applicationhost.config`.

Once the selection is made, use `View | Command Pallette...` to open the
command by this extension and Jexus Manager will be launched.

Next Step
---------
You can now move on to learn how to use Jexus Manager to start/stop the site,
as well as how to open the web browser from there.
