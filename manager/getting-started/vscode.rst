Background
----------
Jexus Manager is designed to be compatible with Microsoft IIS Manager, so that
it can support IIS and IIS Express with intuitive user interface.

Visual Studio Code users often find it difficult to work with IIS/IIS Express,
because no existing extension provides rich access to all settings.

The new IIS and IIS Express extension for Visual Studio Code bridges the two
worlds by launching Jexus Manager with proper settings.

Select Existing Configuration Files
-----------------------------------
If you open an ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core project in VS Code, it might already
have a configuration file generated by Visual Studio or Rider.

This extension scans the working directory and detects all the files that named
`applicationhost.config` so that from newly added status bar button you can
flip among the files or `Use IIS`.

Once the selection is made, use `View | Command Pallette...` to open the
command by this extension and Jexus Manager will be launched.

Next Step
---------
You can now move on to learn how to use Jexus Manager to start/stop the site,
as well as how to open the web browser from there.
