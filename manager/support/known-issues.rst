Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Many editing menu items/buttons currently raise exceptions or do nothing.
  (Will fix gradually)
* Sites in folders with read-only access can be modified but changes cannot be
  saved (and might lead to various issues). (Will fix gradually)
* More ASP.NET related settings. (Coming gradually)
* IIS 7 Express always uses 32 bit processes. (original limitation from
  Microsoft)
* ProcessorAction enum is reset to default value if set to a value IIS 7
  Express does not support. (original limitation from Microsoft)
* Visual Studio integration is under investigation. Changing a site's settings
  (such as bindings) might lead to problems when opening its project file in
  Visual Studio.
* Start/stop a site can take a few seconds, due to the current design to
  health check on IIS Express process.

Local IIS
---------
Only local IIS installation is displayed and displayed in read-only mode. Any
changes made will trigger exceptions (can be ignored safely).

Read/write support is coming in a later build (very likely 3.0).

.. note:: This mode is provided for IIS troubleshooting and compatibility testing.

Jexus
-----
Both local/remote Jexus web servers are supported. Currently this
functionality is being ported from 1.1 to 2.0 new design, so still
experimental.

About how to connect to Jexus web server, please refer to previous
documentation.

Since Jexus only has a few options (compared to IIS/IIS Express), only certain
changes in Jexus Manager affects the configuration files on Jexus side.

More info can be found in `this article <http://jexuswebserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/configuration.html>`_ .
The "Jexus Specific" page at each level provides access to those settings that
have no IIS equivalent.
