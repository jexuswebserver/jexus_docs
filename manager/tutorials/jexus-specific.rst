Jexus Specific
==============

By `Lex Li`_

This page shows you how to use Jexus Manager to manage Jexus specific settings.

Background
----------
Jexus web server does have some special settings that are not yet mapped to IIS
configuration system. However, Jexus Manager hasn't been tested against Jexus
web server for a long time, so the related code might not work as expected.

More information can be found from
`Remote Services release page <https://github.com/jexuswebserver/jxmgr/releases/tag/v1.0>`_.

Jexus Page
----------
Jexus Manager displays a Jexus page for every Jexus web servers it manages.

Since Jexus settings are stored as key-value pair, this simple editor allows
you to modify the pairs freely and apply the changes at will when everything
looks good to you.

.. note:: If you are not sure of any setting, you can click the Help link and
   navigate to our documentation site.
