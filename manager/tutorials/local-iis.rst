Local IIS Instance
==================

By `Lex Li`_

This page shows you how to use Jexus Manager to manage local IIS instance.

Background
----------
There are several issues with IIS Manager that you might not be able to use it
to troubleshoot IIS configuration issuesï¼Œ

* IIS Manager strictly requires administrator permissions.
* When a site configuration contains errors, IIS Manager shows an error dialog
  that tells nothing useful. (A 500.19 error 
  page would be showed when accessing such a site.)

Jexus Manager Benefits
----------------------
Jexus Manager can run as a normal user to navigate the settings, and its
exception dialog provides the same or even better error message when an error
in configuration is detected.
