Visual Studio Project Diagnostics for IIS/IIS Express
=====================================================

By `Lex Li`_

This page shows you how to use Visual Studio Project Diagnostics.

Background
----------
Visual Studio web projects contain some IIS settings, while VS also writes some
settings directly to IIS/IIS Express configuration files. Sometimes such
settings go out of sync and you simply hit the famous errors such as "Unable to
launch the IIS Express Web server".

.. important:: You might spend enough time to dig into the different files on
   your own to achieve the same goal,

   * ``applicationHost.config`` for IIS Express.
   * Project file ``.csproj``.
   * ``launchSettings.json``.

The Built-in Visual Studio Project Diagnostics
----------------------------------------------
For web sites opened in Jexus Manager, there is an action called Project
Diagnostics showed.

Typical things analyzed by Project Diagnostics,

* Visual Studio project type, ASP.NET 4.x or ASP.NET Core.
* Different files that control the settings.
* IIS/IIS Express related settings are extracted and displayed for reference.
* Automatic error detection to locate typical out-of-sync issues.
